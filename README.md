## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**minecraftPlayer21/minecraftPlayer21** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my 'Beginner for Web Dev Coding Portfolio', a coding portfolio documenting my projects, each linked with a GitHub repository and live demo. You can check it out [here](https://malakkhalifa-codingportfolio.netlify.app/).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning advanced GSAP ScrollTrigger animations, Three.js, and React Three Fiber for adding more dynamic 3D animations to my projects.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on frontend development projects, particularly those involving interactive and responsive design.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with backend/frontend projects inspired by my passion for medicine and engineering, based on my personal experience with a traumatic misdiagnosis.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about frontend development, 3D animations, and my journey in web development.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [malakkhalifa10@gmail.com](mailto:malakkhalifa10@gmail.com)
- ðŸŽ¥ Check out my YouTube channel for project explanations and demos [here](#) (link coming soon).
- âš¡ Fun fact:  I'm a second-year Computer Engineering student at the University of Toronto who got into web development through YouTube videos and have been documenting my learning journey on GitHub.
